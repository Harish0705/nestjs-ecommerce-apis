## NestJs Ecommerce APIs with MongoDB ##

As part of NestJs learning, I have created these Ecommerce APIs by understanding the fundamentals of NestJs.

1. Implemented authentication with auth module, controller, service, user entity, jwt and passport.
2. Protected the Product and order route with Auth guard, and implemented CRUD operations for managing products and orders. 
3. Implemented Role based authorization which allows only Admin to perform certain operations.
4. Used Mongoose to work with MongoDB database.
